## Overview
The main objective is to gain basic knowledge in OOP programming. It covers essential topics such as classes, class initializers, orthodox canonical form of classes and class inheritance, providing a solid foundation for advanced programming concepts.

## Key Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming
  - Introduction to OOP principles.
  - Understanding the benefits of using OOP in software development.
- Classes
  - Definition and implementation of a class in C++.
  - Member variables and functions.
  - Access specifiers (public, private, protected).
- Class Initializers
  - Constructors (default, parametrized and copy).
  - Initializing member variables.
  - Understanding the role of destructors in resource management.
- Orthodox Canonical Form
  - Explanation of the Rule of Three in C++.
  - Implementing the copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
  - Ensuring proper resource management in classes.
- Class Inheritance
  - Understanding single and multiple inheritance.
  - Function overriding and the virtual keyword.
  - Constructor and destructor behavior in inheritance.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maciejwiacek/42cpp-modules.git && cd 42cpp-modules
```
2. Compile project in a module
```bash
make
```
3. Run the program
```bash
./program_name
```

## Gained Knowledge:
- Gain a solid understanding of OOP concepts in C++.
- Implement and use classes effectively in programs.
- Develop skills in managing resources using constructors and destructors.
- Understand and apply inheritance in class design.
